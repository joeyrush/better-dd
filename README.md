# Better DD For Laravel
ðŸ˜… Replace your `dump` / `dd` calls with `dumpl` / `ddl` to get the filepath and line number included. A simple but **much needed** feature! Works in both the browser and terminal.

## Requirements
- Laravel (any 4.* / 5.* version)

## Getting Started

You can install the package via composer:
```
composer require joeyrush/better-dd
```

...and that's all!
