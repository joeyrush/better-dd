# Better DD For Laravel
Replace your `dump` and `dd` calls with `dumpl` and `ddl` to get the filepath and line number included. A simple but **much needed** feature IMO ğŸ˜….

## Requirements
- Laravel (any version 4.* / 5.*)

## Getting Started

You can install the package via composer:
```
composer require joeyrush/better-dd
```

...and that's all!
